{{CSSRef}}

The **actual value** of a CSS property is the [used value](/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/used_value) of that property after any necessary approximations have been applied. For example, a user agent that can only render borders with a whole-number pixel width may round the thickness of the border to the nearest integer.
